# Sad Fact
It's always hard for me to remember words. I have no idea how other people can have a large vocabulary and easily capture one from the large library and put it to daily speaking. It looks so hard to me. I always forgot what I was intending to say, or what was the word I was preparing to use.

# Plan
I am planning to enlarge my Eng vocabulary and came up with several plans.

## Action 1 : Remember by word source
- Luckily there are not too many root in Eng words.
- Let me make a list here.

## Action 2 : Idioms
- Learn about some idioms.
